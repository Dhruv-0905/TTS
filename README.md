# TTS
A text to speech model using python's TTS module

Steps:

Step 1: The python's TTS models support versions of python 3.9 or lower, I highly suggest using a Virtual environment [preferably anaconda(conda)], set up the env.

Step 2: Run the Python script in the Virtual Environment by Pasting the file in the virtual env directory (Ensure you have TTS module installed in your virtual env, also check the import if the module is already installed)
